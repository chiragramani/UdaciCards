# UdaciCards

## Project Overview:

For the **UdaciCards** project, we will build a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

This project encompasses the fundamental aspects of building a native application including handling infinite lists, routing, and user input. By building this project, we will gain an understanding of how to use React Native to build an iOS and Android application.


### Project Rubric

The project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the [UdaciCards project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1021/view).The rubric should be a resource you refer to periodically to make sure your project meets specifications.
